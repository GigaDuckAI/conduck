# Third-Party Notices

Conduck's own source code and the neutral placeholder artwork in this repository
are licensed under the Apache License 2.0 — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). This file
lists the third-party components that are part of a Conduck build, in two
categories:

1. **A vendored model artifact** — one compiled machine-learning model checked
   into this repository.
2. **Swift Package Manager dependencies** — sixteen packages that are not
   vendored in this tree; they are fetched at build time and compiled into the
   distributed app binaries. The exact pinned versions and revisions are
   recorded in
   [`Conduck/Conduck.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved`](Conduck/Conduck.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved).
   The list covers direct and transitive packages.

License identities below were verified against the upstream repositories.

## Vendored model artifact

### Silero VAD (Core ML conversion) — model weights, MIT

- **Artifact:** `Conduck/Conduck/Resources/silero-vad-unified-256ms-v6.0.0.mlmodelc`
  (compiled Core ML model, model version 6.0.0)
- **Original model:** Silero VAD by the Silero Team —
  <https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad>
- **Core ML conversion:** FluidInference (authors of the FluidAudio package
  listed below), per the artifact's embedded metadata; Conduck runs the model
  through FluidAudio
- **License:** MIT — applies to the model weights themselves, separately from
  the Apache-2.0 license that covers the FluidAudio code
